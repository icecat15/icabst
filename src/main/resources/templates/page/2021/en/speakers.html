		  <dt>Dr. Thomas Braun</dt>
		  <dd>Professor Of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, USA</dd>
		  <dd><strong>Short Summary</strong>: Thomas Braun received his Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Washington in 1999 and joined the University of Michigan faculty that same year. Dr. Braun's current research interests include: (1) adaptive Phase I trial design methodology, including optimizing schedule of adminstration, accomodating patient heterogeneity, and incorporating multiple toxicity grades; (2) methodology for modeling tooth-level and site-level correlation of teeth in longitudinal dental and periodontal studies, including multivariate longitudinal modeling of clinical attachment level (CAL), pocket depth (PD), and bleeding on probing (BOP), as well as multivariate longitudinal clustering of those outcomes as predictors of site-specific and subject-average progression of oral disease. </dd>
